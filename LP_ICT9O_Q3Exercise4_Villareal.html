	<p>I went to Tokyo last 2017 as a reward for having finished the school year with an "Honors" title. I was really looking forward to it, having heard great things about it from my friends. And let me tell you this: It was as amazing and magical as what I've been told. The surroundings were so clean and quiet. It also felt like a safe place for anyone to stroll around, no matter what place or time. Tokyo also offers a great number of tourist attractions, such as Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo Disney Sea, Tokyo Skytree, Mount Fuji, and many more. A personal favorite of mine is Tokyo Disney Sea; it stood out among the previous Disney parks I've been to. Overall, I enjoyed my entire 8 days in Tokyo. I absolutely adore the city and cannot wait to go back soon.</p>
